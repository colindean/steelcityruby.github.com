          <h3>Handcrafting Community</h3>
          <p>
          Community-building can seem like a herculean effort that must be
          coordinated among many.  But it doesn't have to be.  One is plenty.
          </p>

          <p>
          How can we handcraft a fulfilling code career?  How can we support
          peers in developing theirs, whether newcomer or artisan?  How can we
          contribute, without having to be expert?  How do we develop social
          capital among community members, and channel those investments into
          people who are just entering? How will we craft a thriving community,
          using only simple tools & scarce local resources?
          </p>

          <p>
          We'll examine the history of major successes -- in Ruby community,
          Python, and well beyond -- and extract lessons to apply generally. It's
          a story that weaves in personal narratives of rising into that, both
          well and clumsily.  It's about transforming minor ambitions & frequent
          iterations into a scope of change that looks amazing. By making choices
          to do small things well and thoughtfully, rather than with concern for
          how they scale.

          <h3>Refactoring Fat Models with Patterns</h3>
          <p>
          “Fat models” cause maintenance issues in large apps. Only incrementally
          better than cluttering controllers with domain logic, they usually
          represent a failure to apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
          “Anything related to what a user does” is not a single responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
          Early on, SRP is easier to apply. ActiveRecord classes handle
          persistence, associations and not much else. But bit-by-bit, they grow.
          Objects that are inherently responsible for persistence become the de
          facto owner of all business logic as well. And a year or two later you
          have a User class with over 500 lines of code, and hundreds of methods
          in it’s public interface. Callback hell ensues.
          </p>

          <p>
          This talk will explore patterns to smoothly deal with increasing
          intrinsic complexity (read: features!) of your application. Transform
          fat models into a coordinated set of small, encapsulated objects
          working together in a veritable symphony.

          I am a developer, and I have Type II Bipolar and ADHD.
          </p>

          <p>
          Over the last six months I've been writing and speaking about mental
          illness in the developer community, ever since we lost one of our
          coworkers, Caleb Cornman, to untreated mental illness. There's a lot of
          shame around being sick, and mental illness is treated much differently
          than physical illness, which causes people who are suffering to avoid
          finding help.
          </p>

          <p>
          In this talk I will share the story of my struggles with depression,
          and getting diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar, why it's especially
          relevant for developers, and how we can help those around us who are
          suffering from mental illness.

          <h3>Friendly Flying Robots with Ruby</h3>
          <p>We use Ruby in our Web applications. We use Ruby in our scripting. We
          even use Ruby in our mobile phone applications these days. But here's
          something new: Using Ruby to control flying robots.</p>

          <p>The Parrot AR Drone is a consumer grade quadcopter designed to be
          controlled from your smartphone over a WiFi signal. However, the
          network protocols for controlling the drone are open and published in
          the AR Drone SDK, so what is more natural than using our favorite
          programming language to communicate and control these fun devices.</p>

          <p>This talk will cover the nature of the AR Drone protocol and the
          details of getting a Ruby program to communicate to and control the
          drone. We will talk about the challenges of remote controlling flying
          objects. And if all goes well, we will actually demonstrate all of the
          above.</p>

          <p>After all, admit it.  When robots finally take over the world,
          wouldn't you prefer that they are programming in a friendly
          programming language like Ruby?</p>

          <h3>Deliberate Git</h3>
          <p>
          Git. It seems that everyone is using it and that everyone is using it in
          different ways. Always rebase, never rebase, always fast-forward, always
          no-fast forward, rewrite history, never rewrite history, always squash,
          git-flow, github-flow, commit driven development, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
          Like a good Unix command, git doesn't care how you use it. It enables a wide
          variety of repository workflows. Used effectively git can spin the tale of your
          codebase: where it's been, where it's going, the problems encountered along the
          way. Used ineffectively your git history can become a dense mess of merges
          ballooning out into a multilane spaghetti highway that's impossible for a
          newcomer to navigate.
          </p>

          <p>
          My talk will describe how to safely, sanely, and deliberately use git
          to write the story of your code using three simple rules:
          </p>

          <p>
          1. Use present tense commits. Rather than describe what has happened, tell what
          the commit actively does. This is not just a semantic change, but helps to
          change the way you think about the commit. In the past tense it makes little
          conceptual sense to edit commits. When commits are written in the present,
          active tense then it is an easy mental jump to being able to rewrite, reorder,
          or remove commits.
          </p>

          <p>
          2. Tell your development story. You don't need to preserve every false path
          like a dashed line trail in the Family Circus in your master branch. If it's
          needed or useful, you can safely store the development history in the branch
          itself and only tell the actual story in master.
          </p>

          <p>
          3. Don't tell other developer's stories. Use git to work with the commits made
          by other developers, not to rewrite them after the fact.
          </p>

          <p>
          The techniques I'll share include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>how to rebase against your own branch to fixup, change, and otherwise edit your commits</li>
            <li>how to rebase against upstream commits to clarify your own commits</li>
            <li>how to recognize when your repo history is about to get confusing by examining the incoming and outgoing commits between branches</li>
            <li>using git-stash effectively to save off pieces of work</li>
            <li>using private local branches to isolate your development from public changes until you are ready</li>
          </ul>

          around the world, I'd like to share some of my observations. We'll

          <h3>Keep Software Weird</h3>
          <p>
          How much code coverage does it take it ship a minimal viable product?
          How many Scrum Certifications does it take to make your team agile? How many
          languages learned make a journeyman a master? Currently, in software, there is
          an expressed desire to be taken seriously as craftspeople. To this end, we've
          introduced process, metrics and quantifiable boundaries as goal posts to hold
          up to those who may not understand what is involved in shipping quality
          software. As this practice becomes normal, developers are faced with an
          ever-expanding landscape of techniques, practices and pressure from thought
          leaders to take extra course work or certifications to validate the assertion
          that you are, in fact, a software developer. While some may see this as a
          necessary evolution of our field, I see it as a albatross round the neck of the
          creative developer looking to explore the depths of what is possible. While the
          safety of a well worn path may provide solace to the uninitiated, I find
          dogmatic implementation oppressive and exclusionary to those interested in
          exploring alternative approaches to solving problems with technology. Join me
          in an exploration of what I believe makes us unique as a subculture in this
          business world; examples of how we came to be by challenging the established
          idioms of the past in order to move forward into something exciting and new. To
          be our best we must be willing to dive into the unknown, to loose the binds of
          convention and explore the vast expanse of the unfamiliar. We must dare to be
          wrong, to be new, to be foolish, to be amazing and keep software weird.
